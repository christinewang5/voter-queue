For some reason, Java's PBKDF2 implementation gives different output from Python's.
If you can think of a way to do this in Java, please implement it!
Otherwise, we will be using python. Because python 2 packages will soon be unavailable from the pip repositories,
python 3 is very much preferred.

To check, open up a terminal and type "python --version" and "python3 --version".

If the python3 command works, go to the "Python 3" section.

If the python command works and returns a version number starting in 3, to to the "Python 3" section.

If the python command works and returns a version number starting in 2, to to the "Python 2" section.

If neither command works ("command not found", or something of the like), install Python 3 from "python.org/downloads".
Then go to the "Python 3" section.

Python 2:
    Ensure that you have pbkdf2 and pycrypto installed, by running "pip install pbkdf2 pycrypto" from a terminal.
    Open a python shell by running "python" in a terminal.
    Then run the following commands, replacing REPLACEME with your new password.
        from pbkdf2 import PBKDF2
        from Crypto import Random
        from base64 import b64encode
        salt = Random.new().read(32)
        key = PBKDF2(passphrase="REPLACEME", salt=salt, iterations=100).read(32)
        print "key =\""+b64encode(key)+"\"\nsalt=\""+b64encode(salt)+"\""
    Record the values that the last command outputs.
    Then replace the values of the "key" and "salt" variables in CryptoLib with the values you recorded.

Python 3:
    Ensure that you have pbkdf2 and pycrypto installed, by running "pip3 install pbkdf2 pycrypto" from a terminal.
    Open a python shell by running "python3" in a terminal.
    Then run the following commands, replacing REPLACEME with your new password.
        from pbkdf2 import PBKDF2
        from Crypto import Random
        from base64 import b64encode
        salt = Random.new().read(32)
        key = PBKDF2(passphrase="REPLACEME", salt=salt, iterations=100).read(32)
        print("key =\""+b64encode(key).decode("UTF-8")+"\"\nsalt=\""+b64encode(salt).decode("UTF-8")+"\"")
    Record the values that the last command outputs.
    Then replace the values of the "key" and "salt" variables in CryptoLib with the values you recorded.
